        <h2>Tic Tac Toe Bot</h2>
        <a class="project-link" href="https://github.com/anigmea/TicTacToe" target="_blank">View on GitHub</a>
        <ul>
          <li>Developed a reinforcement learning-based Tic Tac Toe bot using Min-Max and Q-learning algorithms for optimal decision-making.</li>
          <li>Conducted empirical testing of bot performance against random strategies.</li>
          <li>Achieved a 100% win rate against random moves and consistent draws against optimal opponents.</li>
          <li>Explored optimal strategies and decision trees to enhance performance in constrained environments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Frozen Lake Solver</h2>
        <a class="project-link" href="https://github.com/anigmea/frozen_lake" target="_blank">View on GitHub</a>
        <ul>
          <li>Engineered a Q-learning model to solve OpenAIâ€™s gym Frozen Lake puzzle with 79% accuracy after 10,000+ training episodes.</li>
          <li>Applied reinforcement learning to solve pathfinding problems under uncertain, stochastic conditions.</li>
          <li>Provided insights into real-world applications of machine learning in grid-based environments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ecommerce - MERN Stack Web Application</h2>
        <a class="project-link" href="https://crossover.in.net/" target="_blank">Live Demo</a>
        <ul>
          <li>Developed a full-stack application using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js (MERN).</li>
          <li>Deployed on a Digital Ocean Droplet; handled server configuration, DNS, and deployment workflows.</li>
          <li>Utilized asynchronous programming in Node.js (event loop, promises, async/await, worker threads) for optimized API performance.</li>
          <li>Implemented RESTful APIs and scalable backend with Axios handling asynchronous API calls.</li>
          <li>Integrated Git for version control and followed CI/CD practices for testing and deployment.</li>
          <li>Designed robust APIs capable of handling 100+ daily requests and reduced latency by 20%.</li>
        </ul>
